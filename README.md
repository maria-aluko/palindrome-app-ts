# Palindrome App

A simple app to check whether a word, number, or phrase is a palindrome.

- A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar, the date "22/02/2022" and the sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).

Built with React and TypeScript.
